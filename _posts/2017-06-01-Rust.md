# Getting started

The first place to begin is with the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The book will take you through all parts of Rust you need to get started creating your own projects

### Highlights

Installing Rust on a Unix/linux system:

   ```
      curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   ```
