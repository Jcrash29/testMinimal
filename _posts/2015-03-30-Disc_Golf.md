I started playing disc golf in 2009 as a freshman at the University of Califonria Santa Cruz. I very quickly took over many leadership roles on the team including organizing tournaments, weekly practices, and raised money for the team. During my tenure as a leader of the team I worked with multiple organziations on campus to get a disc golf course on campus approved. It took many hours of campainging and organization but in the end the disc golf course was approved.
