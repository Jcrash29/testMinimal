# Git

Over the last four years I have become very familiar and comfortable with git. I have realized several of my friends and colleagues are not fans of it, so I have compiled a list of common commands.

As a note: [The FBI also unwillingly provided several useful git commands, and uses.](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_1179773.html)

### git add -u

The -u option will stage all modified files. 

### git push origin :"branch"

Delete a branch from origin

### git commit `--`amend 

Rewrite history of the last commit and add The Current staged files to the last commit. 

### git submodule foreach "git command"

This will go through each of the submodules and run the given command.  Useful for a git checkout or a git clean/reset

### git log `--`name-only

Show the log along with the name of all files.
