In my last months of living in Santa Cruz California I decided to go on a final bike tour with a great group of friends. The goal was to travel from Santa Cruz to San Fransisco. We didn't know what we would do once we got there, but that was half the fun.

# Day 1

The first day we left Santa Cruz with all our friends. Stopping at the [Swanton Berry Farm](swantonberryfarm.com) to get some fresh fruit and baked good. We setup camp just outside of Hi Pidgeon Point Light House.

# Day 2 

For breakfast we back-tracked to [Highway 1 Brewing Company](highway1brewing.com) for breakfast and an early morning stout. After breakfast we headed out to Half Moon Bay which would put us half way to San Fransisco. The inital plan had been to sleep on the beach. We showed up and were greeted by a beach-closed sign. Apperently there was construction taking place that weekend on trees on the beach, and they were not allowing anyone to camp. Suddenly we were out of luck, tired, with no where to stay. Luckily we found a trailer park with 4 tiny camp sites where we could setup for a night or two.

# Day 3

At this point many people had abandonded our plans. A friend drove north and picked up the members who couldn't continue. Three of us, John, Jen, and myself left our camping gear with those driving home, and continued on to San Fransisco with much lighter packs.

Getting into San Fransisco we stopped for coffee, and beers. We than caught the last forms of public transportation back to Santa Cruz.

It was a great last hurrah for my 6 years in Santa Cruz.
